# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

Sample ðŸ”¥FHIR resources for patients and providers managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and other health conditions.

These sample data are based on data element analysis by the [Electronic CKD Care Plan Working Group of the NIH National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/communication-programs/nkdep/working-groups/health-information-technology/development-electronic-ckd-care-plan). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged or cannot filter blood as well as healthy kidneys.

These examples emphasize patients with multiple chronic conditions. In 2015, Medicare spending for chronic conditions indicates that 24% of all beneficiaries were diagnosed with both chronic kidney disease and hypertension, 33% were diagnosed with both hypertension and diabetes, and 17% of beneficiaries are diagnosed with all three of these conditions. Adults with diabetes, high blood pressure, or both have a higher risk of developing CKD than those without these diseases.

Clinical Scenarios
===================
Example "Persona" documents are available from the NIH web site describing healthcare needs and challenges for several [Patients](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/-/media/Files/Health-Information/Communication-Programs/NKDEP/Patient_Personas_508.pdf) and [Providers](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/-/media/Files/Health-Information/Communication-Programs/NKDEP/Provider_Personas_508.pdf) managing care for multiple chronic conditions, including CKD. These sample FHIR resources are based on these patient journeys.
